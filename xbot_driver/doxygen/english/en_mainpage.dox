The kobuki driver is a simple c++ library that allows interfacing to the kobuki mobile research base. Before

@subsection who Target Users

This documentation is targeted for users creating a custom robot on top of kobuki using either posix/win32 or
an apple operating system. If that is you, you are in the right place - proceed to the guides below.
If you're interested in developing a driver for a custom unsupported platform (e.g. vxworks) then you'll want
to check the serial protocol reference in the @ref enAppendixProtocolSpecification "appendix".

Alternatively, if you're using a <i>kobuki reference platform</i>, check one of the links below.

- <i>Turtlebot</i> : refer to the documentation for <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot">turtlebot</a>.
- <i>Ros on Kobuki</i> : refer to the documentation for the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/kobuki">kobuki node</a>.
- <i>Other</i> : if you would like your platform listed here, contact the maintainers of this project.

@subsection design Design

Firstly, note that the library isn't designed to run your control loop. Robots are quite varied - everything from something really
simple running on very minimal embedded resources to a fully fledged system. There is also a wide variety of architectures that a
driver must neatly integrate with, so we have left the decision on how to design and integrate the driver up to
the user. To that end, the driver is simply a library of classes, simple functions and callback oriented
@ref enSigslotsGuide "sigslots".

We have a simple implementation in the guides below and a more detailed implementation can be found for the
<a href="http://ros.org/wiki/kobuki">kobuki_node</a> that runs within the ros framework.
